You’ll find this post in your `_posts_` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:

`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `MARKUP` is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight cpp %}
int main(int argc, char **argv) {
  return 0;
}
{% endhighlight %}

$$
K(a,b) = \int \mathcal{D}x(t) \exp(2\pi i S[x]/\hbar)
$$
\\[
    \binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}
\\]
